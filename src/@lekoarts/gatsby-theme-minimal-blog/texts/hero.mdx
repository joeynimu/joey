<Text sx={{ fontSize: [3, 4, 5], fontWeight: `bold`, color: `heading` }}>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joe!</Text>

I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I mostly build React apps powered by GraphQL backends.

I learn by sharing my knowledge with the community through blog posts, workshops, and Open-source. I also hold [Graphql meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Nairobi-GraphQL-Meetup/) so be sure to check that out if that's your jam.

I take contract/project-based jobs from time to time. If you want to discuss a project, you can drop me an email at joeynimu[at]gmail.com.

During my spare time, I spend time with my family, watching Liverpool FC play and making road trips to discover new places.
