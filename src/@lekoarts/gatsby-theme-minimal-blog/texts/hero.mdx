I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya. I love using React, GraphQL, Node, and everything else in between.

I currently work at Twigafoods as a Lead Frontend Engineer, where I help build fantastic customer-facing products as well as internal dashboards and tooling.

During my spare time, I contribute to some of my favorite Open Source Projects, spending time with my family, and making road trips to discover my country.
